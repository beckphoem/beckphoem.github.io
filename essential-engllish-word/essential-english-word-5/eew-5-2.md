# The Helpful Abbey 

It had not rained on the **prairie** for several months. Because of the **drought**, the climate had become very **arid**. There was no **moisture** left in the soil. No crops could grow in the dry ground. By wintertime, the people had nothing to eat.

The hungry families heard about an **abbey** near the mountains where food and water was still **abundant**. So they traveled **inland**, across the **prairie**, to the **abbey**.

At first only a few families arrived, seeking food and shelter. Then there was **ample** food. The monks fed them and let them sleep in the small **cathedral**.

Soon, however, more families were arriving every day. These people had to travel farther, so they were in worse condition. The **rugged** journey had made their clothes **ragged**. They were cold and tired. The tiny **cathedral** was soon full.

Food became **scarce**. The monks began to **grumble**. They began to **speculate** that there would be no food. “If more families come, we won’t make it through the winter,” said a young monk. “We must ask some of them to leave.”

The abbot heard this. “We cannot do that,” he said. “It would be wrong to **deprive** them of food and shelter. We took an **oath** to help those that need help. All here are in need, so all are **eligible** to receive our food and shelter.”

“But we won’t have enough,” the monk said.

“That might be true, but we must help them **nonetheless**. We will **fast**,” the abbot replied. “Also, we will give our rooms in the **abbey** to those sleeping outside, and we will sleep in the churchyard that **adjoins** the **cathedral**.”

The monks were reluctant at first, but they did what the oldest monk said. By the end of winter, there was still enough food and shelter for everyone. They learned that sometimes helping others means you must give more help than you first expected.
