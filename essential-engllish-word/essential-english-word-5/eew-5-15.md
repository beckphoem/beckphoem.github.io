Ernest threw a large package onto the boat. He yelled, “Here! You can **inflate** this boat to get you back to land.”
“Get out of here!” screamed the old man.
Ernest was confused. “Don’t you need help?” he asked. “Your ship doesn’t seem **adequate** enough to sail so far away from land.”
“You’ve just scared away a huge fish,” the boy said. “We waved to let you know you were too close to us.”
Ernest turned around and headed home. He learned that it’s better not to help unless asked to. Otherwise, you might not help anyone at all.
