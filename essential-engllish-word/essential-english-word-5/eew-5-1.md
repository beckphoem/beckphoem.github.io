# The Little Mice 

Beth was a very **resourceful** and conservative mouse. She knew that winter was coming and that there would soon be a **dearth** of food. So she decided to make gathering food for winter her primary job. Gathering food was a **grueling** and **mundane** activity, but Beth made a **deliberate** effort because she knew that it was important. She **allotted** herself a few hours every day to collect beans. By winter, she had collected a massive pile and hid them in a **cache**.

Beth had a sister named Mary. Mary lacked ambition. She had **fanciful** ideas about how she would survive winter. She thought that food would just come to her and that she could work at her own **convenience**. She **opted** to spend the days playing and dancing, instead of gathering beans. When the final hours of autumn **elapsed**, Mary had only a **paltry** amount of food stored away.

Mary realized that her food supply was too small to last through winter. She visited her sister. Mary said, “Beth, lamina **dire** situation. I didn’t gather enough food for winter. Will you let me share your beans? Please have some **empathy** for your sister!”

![alt text](eew-5-1/23.png)

Beth thought for a moment. Then she replied, “Mary, I am truly sorry for you. But I will not give you any of my beans. Instead, I will let you have my empty bag. You can still work hard and gather enough food for the winter. It will be **tedious**, but you will learn the value of hard work.”

Beth’s words **appalled** Mary. Mary cried with **outrage**, “There is too much work! I won’t have any time to dance or play!”

![alt text](eew-5-1/25.png)

Beth said, “It is crucial that you gather enough food. You must have **sustenance** before you have fun. Go now, and **rectify** your situation.”

Mary **griped** some more, but she knew that her sister was right. She took the bag and went to work gathering her own beans for the winter.
