One day, the mayor **appointed** Mark to build a **monument**: a statue of Egyptian Pharaoh, Tut. Mark agreed to do the job, but he had a problem. He had no idea who Pharaoh Tut was\! However, he thought he had the **competence** to build a good statue anyway. He made some **crude** measurements and sculpted a statue of a very old man with a **tattoo** on his chest. Mark was proud of his work, but when John saw the statue, he laughed aloud.

“What’s so funny?” Mark asked.

John replied, “Your **ignorance** makes me laugh. Don’t you know that Tut was only a teenager when he was pharaoh? Let me help you. I’ll **supervise** your work. I’ll give you **feedback**, and we’ll make this a great monument.”

Mark got another **cube** of stone. John told him what Tut looked like. “Make him tall with good **posture**,” John said. “And make sure there is **symmetry** in his body.”

Mark **conferred** with John about every detail. For ten **consecutive** hours, the brothers worked. At last, the finished statue was **situated** in front of the museum. Everyone **applauded** the brothers’ good work.

“We worked together very well. I guess we are **compatible** after all,” Mark said.

John replied, “I agree\! When we combine our talents, we are capable of greatness.”
