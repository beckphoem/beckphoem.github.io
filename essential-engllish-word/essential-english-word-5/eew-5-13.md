# The Canteen

The university canteen was a large **facility** that had to **cater** to the entire student body. The head of the **faculty**, Mr. Jones, was a **considerate** man. He wanted to improve the canteen. The main **criteria** for the improvements were quality and speed. The **external** walls were painted, and a new floor was laid.

Inside, the long, **impersonal** tables were replaced with smaller, round ones. In the corner, they placed a beautiful golden **ornament**—a statue of a running **hound**. Mr. Jones felt this new atmosphere would **entitle** students to a better dining experience. He even had a small, clean **brook** built to run through the outdoor seating area, which was a lovely **sanctuary** for students.

However, there were problems. The Earth’s **crust** in that area was unstable, and a pipe burst, creating a large **heap** of mud. This began to **degrade** the new floor. Also, food **consumption** went down. Students complained that the menu was boring. A lone **pedestrian** walking by told a student, “I wouldn’t eat here.”

Mr. Jones decided to **escort** a group of student leaders through the kitchen. He showed them how the food was prepared. One student, a geology major from the Southern **Hemisphere**, pointed out that the food was just piled onto plates without care. The students were not just a **spectator** group; they were the customers. Mr. Jones realized he needed to improve the food itself, not just the building.
