He thought that all people were as cruel and uncaring as his owner had been. He was ready to give up when he heard a soft voice say, “What a beautiful **hound**!” Elvis looked up and saw an old woman. She said, “You’re **entitled** to a better life than this. I can take you to a **sanctuary** for old dogs like you. I’ll **cater** to all your needs. Would you like to come with me?”
