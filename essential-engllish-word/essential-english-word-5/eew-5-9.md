# The Weaving Machine

Mr. Joseph Franklin invented a machine that could **weave** cloth. It wove faster and straighter than anyone could **weave** by hand. He decided to take it to two cities on a **peninsula**, Netherton and Wilton. In these cities, a large **proportion** of the people worked in weaving. Joseph felt sure he could sell his machine there.

Joseph first took his machine to the mayor of Netherton. “Think of the money you will earn from this machine!” Joseph said to him.

But the mayor was a **benevolent** man. He knew about the people’s **dependence** on weaving for their livelihood. If he bought the machine, the people would lose their jobs. So he refused to buy it.

Joseph said, “We are no longer in the **medieval** age! Soon everything will be made by machines. Cloth made by hand will soon be **obsolete**. If you don’t change your **archaic** ways, your town’s income will **diminish**!”

But the mayor said, “I don’t like **capitalism**. Don’t **impose** your **radical** ideas on my town. Go away!”

![alt text](eew-5-9/25.png)

So Joseph took his machine to the mayor at Wilton. This mayor thought Joseph’s machine was **spectacular** and spent a long time looking at its different **components** made of **brass**. The mayor couldn’t **refute** the fact that the machine had **drawbacks** that would affect the people’s jobs. But he realized the machine could bring money and **prestige**. So he ordered Joseph to build twenty of them.

Within a year, Wilton was a wealthy city, famous for its wonderful cloth. People no longer wove but worked in **managerial** jobs at cloth factories instead. Nobody bought the cloth from Netherton anymore. The people of Netherton became poor and hungry.

Finally, the mayor of Netherton called Joseph and said, “Now I realize that your machine is not just a passing **fad**. To succeed in business, we must be willing to change.” He then ordered twenty weaving machines.

After that, both Netherton and Wilton became rich cities, famous throughout the land for their wonderful cloth.
