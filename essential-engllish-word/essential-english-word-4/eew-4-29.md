# The **Solar** Car Race

We live in a **mobile** society. But the cars we drive require too much gas, plus they **pollute** the air. Eventually, the natural resources used to make gas will run out. So what happens then? Many people think **solar**-powered **automobiles** are the answer. To learn more about this type of **transportation**, teams from universities and **corporate** organizations gather in Australia every two years for a **solar** car race.

![alt text](eew-4-29/21.png)

The race is called the World **Solar** Challenge. **Candidates** for this **tournament** must design their own cars. The teams keep all their plans **confidential**. They don’t **interact** with other teams because the race is very competitive. And these cars aren’t just **enhanced** and **modified** versions of normal cars. They are completely different.

The cars only have room for one person and are very simple inside—they don’t even have a cushion for the driver to sit on. These cars are shorter and much more flat than normal cars. Most importantly, the cars **incorporate** **solar** panels onto the outside that lie **parallel** to each other. These panels are made from materials that take in light from the sun and turn it into electric energy. That’s how they move.

These cars race over 3,000 kilometers across the Australian **territories**. The drivers have to heed strict **guidelines**. They must stop at certain **intervals** to charge their batteries. And unlike normal race cars, they can’t go very fast. They have to drive at the normal speed limits. Although the drivers want to finish the race quickly, that is not the main goal. The objective is to see how well the cars work under normal driving conditions.

![alt text](eew-4-29/24.png)

Because of the World **Solar** Challenge, a new **era** in car making and in driving is beginning. People may **ridicule** the **solar** cars because they look strange, but this is a **phenomenon** that isn’t going away. Using the technology from the vehicles, car makers will eventually create **solar** cars for the rest of us.
