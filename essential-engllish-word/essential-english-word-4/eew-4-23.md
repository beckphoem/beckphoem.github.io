# How the Dinosaurs Really Died

Many scientists and **intellectuals** think that dinosaurs died when an **asteroid** smashed into the Earth millions of years ago. However, recently, there has been some **controversy** over this theory. Some scientists think that it isn’t **accurate**. They think that a tiny insect may have been the biggest **factor** in the death of these huge creatures. That insect was the mosquito.

These scientists do think that an **asteroid** hit the Earth the time of the dinosaurs. But that wasn’t what killed all of them. At that time, insects, including the mosquito, were beginning to **evolve**. Today, we can **regulate** the number of mosquitoes with **pesticides**. But that was impossible millions of years ago. The mosquitoes **multiplied** quickly. And they were certainly not idle. Since there were so many mosquitoes, it was easy for them to bite many of the dinosaurs. When they bit another living thing, the mosquitoes passed along a deadly disease. So the dinosaurs were **stricken** with the disease. A **vast** **majority** of them, from the **vegetarians** to the meat eaters, died.

To **reinforce** this idea, scientists stress how gradually the dinosaurs died. If an **asteroid** killed them, they would have died very quickly. But the number of dinosaurs decreased slowly. In addition, scientists have found **genetic** material of mosquitoes in fossils. This material proves that mosquitoes existed back then. Although there may have been other **factors**, the dinosaurs died mainly because of disease, the scientists say.

No matter how it happened, the dinosaurs’ death had a major impact on other living things. Many dinosaurs ate **mammals**. After the dinosaurs died, **mammals** were able to **evolve** and produce **offspring**. Birds also **evolved**. Scientists have **analyzed** the **genomes** of birds, and they discovered that birds have **identical** **genetic** material to some dinosaurs. So there may still be dinosaurs among us after all.
