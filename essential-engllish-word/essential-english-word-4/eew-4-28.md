# Thucydides and the Plague of Athens

Thucydides was the world’s first historian. **Presently**, we get most of our knowledge about ancient Greece from his writing. But Thucydides didn’t just write about history, he lived through it. However, he almost didn’t survive one historical event: the **Plague** of Athens.

In 430 BCE, an army attacked the city of Athens, where Thucydides lived. Thousands of people hid from the army behind Athens’ large walls. The city became very crowded as the population **expanded**. Then a **horrifying** disease broke out. People **summoned** doctors. But it was to no **avail** because no one understood how the disease spread. It seemed **random**. They didn’t know that it was an **organism**. Instead, they **defined** disease as a punishment from their gods. Thucydides was **incredulous** that gods caused the **plague**, but he explained why others believed it. There was an old, long verse which predicted the disease. To **paraphrase** it, the verse said the gods would send a disease during a war. As a result, large crowds gathered at **shrines** to ask the gods to stop the **plague**. But the situation only **worsened** because these people were so close to each other they became sick. That’s how they learned a **fundamental** lesson about the **plague**: it spread from person to person.

People wanted to leave the crowded city, but they **dreaded** what the army outside would do to them. At this time, Thucydides got sick, too.

There were **riots**, and people ignored laws. They didn’t think they’d live long enough to be punished. Many sick people were left to die in **solitude** because no one wanted to be near them.
