“I just need to borrow some money. I swear that I’ll spend it in **moderation**, and my friend will pay you back tomorrow,” the man said. The innkeeper gave his **consent** and pulled out some money.

The traveler knew that this was a trick. The man was going to leave with the poor innkeeper’s money and never return. He felt **compassion** for the nice innkeeper and did not want him to be tricked. The **cunning** traveler decided to teach the innkeeper a lesson.

The traveler walked over to the innkeeper and sat down. The innkeeper had started to **grind** coffee beans to make coffee. He made the coffee and handed the traveler a **saucer** and a cup. The two started talking. After a while the traveler yawned and then growled like a wolf.

“Are you not **sane**? I thought I just heard you growl,” said the innkeeper.

“I did. I am cursed. Every time I yawn three times in a row, I turn into a wolf and attack people.”

The innkeeper became **tense**. Then the traveler yawned again. As the traveler started to yawn a third time, the innkeeper turned to run outside. As he ran, the traveler **snatched** his coat. The scared innkeeper **staggered** outside and **tumbled** into the street.

The traveler followed him out because he did not want to **withhold** the truth any longer. He just wanted to **foster** happiness and restore the innkeeper’s emotional **equilibrium**. The innkeeper was **dizzy**, and he **stumbled**. The traveler helped him stand up.

“That was a trick,” the traveler said as he returned the coat.

“Oh, good. I **cherish** this coat,” responded the innkeeper.

“Well, hopefully this will teach you that you shouldn’t believe every story that you hear.
