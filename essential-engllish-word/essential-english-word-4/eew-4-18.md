Later, his friend Robby asked him, “Have you seen the **script** for the play?”

![alt text](eew-4-18/22.png)

“Yes. The title is The Lost **Glove**—it’s a **comic** play,” replied Peter.

![alt text](eew-4-18/23.png)

Robby said, “I want to play the part of the **hermit** because the **hermit** gets to talk with an **accent**!”

![alt text](eew-4-18/24.png)

“I want the lead role of the **barber**. I didn’t know you liked acting. I thought you liked **choir** better,” said Peter.

“Acting is also a hobby of mine. Do you want to practice with me? The **basement** at my house is quiet. It’s perfect!” Robby replied.

“I don’t like practicing with others. It **complicates** the process for me,” said Peter.

Actually, Peter didn’t want to practice at all. The teacher would surely **reserve** the lead part for him. A few days later, Robby came to his house.

Robby said, “Do you want to practice the scene on the **staircase**? It’s the part where the migrant **searches** for a new job.”

![alt text](eew-4-18/26.png)

Peter **declined** the invitation. “I can’t today. I need to do some **errands**.” Then he **slammed** the door. It was just an excuse. Peter didn’t want to help Robby.

On the day of auditions, Peter wore his lucky **leather** jacket. He always got the best part when he wore it. The teacher told him to begin, but his mind was **blank**. He couldn’t **blink** his eyes and looked again. He didn’t get the lead part—Robby did! Peter **pondered** the situation and came to the idea that Robby **justly** received the part. He earned it by practicing. Next time, Peter would practice, too.
