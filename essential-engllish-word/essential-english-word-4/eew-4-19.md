“The first time I flew, the plane shook so bad that **cargo** started falling. My parents told me to listen to music and read a **chapter** in my book. It calmed me,” Rachel said.

Suddenly, the plane shook again. This time, Isaac followed Rachel’s advice. He put on headphones and took out a book by his favorite **author**. The book and the music helped Isaac feel better. After a while, he didn’t even notice the bad weather. The bad situation didn’t feel so bad after someone helped him.
