## THE BROTHERS AND THE BREAD

Two brothers wanted to go outside and play. However, because the only bread in the house was **stale**, their mother told them they needed to bake fresh bread.

![alt text](eew-4-14/21.png)

“I have to have the car repaired,” she said. “When I return, if the bread is ready, you can play.”

![alt text](eew-4-14/22.png)

The brothers hurried to prepare the bread, but not carefully. They didn’t **sift** the flour. They were careless and **sprinkle**d too much salt into the **mixture**. The **dough** needed to be soft and **flexible**, but the salt made it into a **lump** that was as hard as a **brick**.

![alt text](eew-4-14/23.png)

The younger brother **utter**ed a sigh. “Now we have to start again,” he said.

![alt text](eew-4-14/24.png)

“No, we don’t,” the older brother replied. “I’ll fix it. I just need to make the **dough** flat again and add water to it.”

![alt text](eew-4-14/25.png)

He decided to hit the ball of **dough** with his **fist** to make it flat. But he hit it so hard that it flew right off of the table and knocked over a glass, which **shatter**ed. The **dough** then crashed into the kitchen window’s **shutter**s and **crumble**d. Luckily, the brothers were not **injure**d, but they did make a huge mess.


A **slight** mistake now became a major problem. The brothers had **ruin**ed the kitchen. Just then their mother returned. She saw the mess and became **flush**ed with anger.

“Now you can’t play,” she said. “Instead, you have to clean the kitchen. I want this kitchen to be so clean that it may **sparkle**!”

The brothers cleaned the floor and **express**ed their sorrow to their mother. Soon, they were **reconcile**d. But there was no bread, and it was too late to play. They realized that trying to do something quickly often makes more work.
