79.

81.
A: I need a vacation.

82.
A: Where would you go if you could go anywhere?

83.
A: That would be an amazing trip.
B: One day, hopefully.

84.
A: Did you get my email?
B: Yes, I was just about to reply.

85.
A: No rush. Take your time.
B: Thanks. I'll get back to you this afternoon.

86.
A: The traffic is terrible today.
B: It always is during rush hour.

87.
A: I wish I could work from home.
B: That would be the dream.

88.
A: This soup is a little too salty.

89.
A: No, it's okay. I'll manage.

93.

94.

96.
A: Your total comes to $49.99.

99.
A: What are you reading?

100.
A: Is it any good?
B: I can't put it down.

101.
A: Who is your favorite author?
B: I really like Stephen King.

102.
A: I love his books too.
B: We have something in common then.

103.
A: What's that noise?
B: I think it's the wind.

104.
A: It sounds a bit spooky.
B: It's just an old house.

105.
A: I can't wait for summer.
B: Me neither. I love the warm weather.

106.
A: Beach days are the best.
B: Absolutely. And barbecues.

107.
A: I'm not feeling well.
B: You should see a doctor.

108.
A: I think it's just a cold.
B: It's better to be safe than sorry.

109.
A: You're right. I'll make an appointment.
B: I hope you feel better soon.

110.
A: Thank you for your concern.
B: That's what friends are for.

111.
A: Can you turn up the volume?
B: Sure. Is this loud enough?

112.
A: A little more, please.
B: How about now?

113.
A: That's perfect, thanks.
B: No problem.

114.
A: This is my favorite song.
B: It has a great beat.

115.
A: I could listen to this all day.
B: It is very catchy.

116.
A: Do you play any musical instruments?
B: I play the guitar.

117.
A: How long have you been playing?
B: For about five years now.

118.
A: You must be really good.
B: I'm okay. I still have a lot to learn.

119.
A: Practice makes perfect.
B: That's very true.

120.
A: I'm thinking of starting a new hobby.
B: What are you interested in?

121.
A: Maybe painting or photography.
B: Both sound very creative.

122.
A: I'm not sure which one to choose.
B: Why not try both and see which one you prefer?

123.
A: That's a good idea.
B: I'm sure you'll be great at whichever you choose.

124.
A: Thanks for the encouragement.
B: Any time.

125.
A: I have some good news.
B: I'm all ears.

126.
A: I got the promotion!
B: Congratulations! That's wonderful news.

127.
A: I'm so happy.
B: You deserve it. You've worked so hard.

128.
A: We should celebrate.
B: Definitely. Dinner is on me tonight.

129.
A: You don't have to do that.
B: I insist. It's a special occasion.

130.
A: Well, in that case, thank you.
B: It's my pleasure.

131.
A: What time should we meet?
B: How does 8 PM sound?

132.
A: 8 PM works for me.
B: Great. See you then.

133.
A: I'm running a little late.
B: No worries. I'm already here.

134.
A: I'll be there in 10 minutes.
B: Take your time. There's no rush.

135.
A: Thanks for being so understanding.
B: It happens to the best of us.

136.
A: How long have you been waiting?
B: Just a few minutes.

137.
A: Can you recommend a good restaurant around here?
B: The bistro across the street is excellent.

138.
A: What kind of food do they serve?
B: It's modern European cuisine.

139.
A: Is it expensive?
B: It's a bit pricey, but worth it.

140.
A: Thanks for the tip. I'll check it out.
B: I hope you enjoy it.

141.
A: I'm lost. Can you show me on the map?
B: Of course. We are right here.

142.
A: And where is the museum?
B: It's over there, just two blocks away.

143.
A: I see. It's not too far.
B: You can walk there in five minutes.

144.
A: Thank you for your help.
B: You're welcome. Enjoy the museum.

145.
A: Do you have Wi-Fi here?
B: Yes, we do.

146.
A: What's the password?
B: It's on the sign behind the counter.

147.
A: Oh, I see it. Thanks.
B: No problem.

148.
A: My phone battery is about to die.
B: You can use my portable charger if you want.

149.
A: Really? That would be amazing.
B: Here you go.

150.
A: I owe you one.
B: It's no big deal.

151.
A: This place is so crowded.
B: It's always like this on a Saturday.

152.
A: Let's find a quieter spot.
B: Good idea. Follow me.

153.
A: This is much better.
B: I told you I knew a good place.

154.
A: How was your trip?
B: It was incredible. I had a great time.

155.
A: Did you take a lot of pictures?
B: Yes, hundreds of them.

156.
A: I'd love to see them sometime.
B: I'll show them to you next time we meet.

157.
A: It's a deal.
B: I'll hold you to that.

158.
A: I'm not a fan of spicy food.
B: I can ask them to make it mild for you.

159.
A: Could you do that? That would be great.
B: Absolutely. I'll let the waiter know.

160.
A: What would you like to drink?
B: I'll have a glass of orange juice.

161.
A: I'll have the same.
B: Two orange juices, coming right up.

162.
A: I need to go to the bank.
B: There's one right next to the post office.

163.
A: Is it open now?
B: I believe it closes at 5 PM.

164.
A: I should hurry then.
B: You still have plenty of time.

165.
A: I prefer tea to coffee.
B: What's your favorite kind of tea?

166.
A: I like green tea.
B: It's very healthy.

167.
A: Have you ever been to Paris?
B: No, but I've always wanted to go.

168.
A: It's a beautiful city.
B: I can imagine.

169.
A: I can't believe it's already December.
B: This year has flown by.

170.
A: Do you have any plans for New Year's Eve?
B: Not yet. I'm still figuring it out.

171.
A: Let me know if you want to do something together.
B: I will. Thanks for the invitation.

172.
A: It's my treat.
B: Oh, you shouldn't have.

173.
A: It's the least I can do.
B: Well, thank you. That's very kind of you.

174.
A: What are you watching on TV?
B: It's a documentary about space.

175.
A: It looks interesting.
B: Do you want to join me?

176.
A: Sure, I've got nothing else to do.
B: Great. Scoot over.

177.
A: Could you please close the door?
B: Of course.

178.
A: It's a bit drafty in here.
B: Is that better?

179.
A: Yes, much better.
B: Good.

180.
A: I'm thinking of redecorating my room.
B: What color scheme are you going for?

181.
A: Something calm, like light blue and white.
B: That will look very peaceful.

182.
A: I hope so. I need a change.
B: A new look can make a big difference.

183.
A: I completely agree.
B: Let me know if you need help painting.

184.
A: Would you really help?
B: For sure. It'll be fun.

185.
A: That would be amazing.
B: Just tell me when.

186.
A: I'll keep you posted.
B: Sounds like a plan.

187.
A: I'm not very good at sports.
B: Neither am I. I'm very clumsy.

188.
A: I prefer watching to playing.
B: Me too. It's less effort.

189.
A: What's your favorite team?
B: I don't really follow sports.

190.
A: Oh, I see.
B: I'm more into movies and music.

191.
A: We have that in common.
B: What's the last movie you saw?

192.
A: I saw the new superhero movie.
B: Was it good? I've been meaning to see it.

193.
A: It was action-packed. You'd like it.
B: I'll definitely check it out this weekend then.

194.
A: Let me know what you think.
B: I will.

195.
A: The service here is very slow.
B: Yes, we've been waiting for a while.

196.
A: I'm going to try and get the waiter's attention.
B: Good luck with that.

197.
A: Excuse me! Could we order, please?
B: I'll be with you in a moment.

198.
A: Well, at least he saw us.
B: That's a start, I suppose.

199.
A: I'm trying to cut down on sugar.
B: It's hard, isn't it?

200.
A: It's in everything!
B: I know. It's a real challenge.

201.
A: But I feel so much better since I started.
B: That's great to hear. Keep it up.

202.
A: I will. It's worth it.
B: Your health is the most important thing.

203.
A: I couldn't agree more.
B: Cheers to that.

204.
A: I'm afraid of heights.
B: So you probably don't like roller coasters.

205.
A: I can't even look down from a high balcony.
B: I understand. Everyone has their fears.

206.
A: What are you afraid of?
B: I'm terrified of spiders.

207.
A: Even the small ones?
B: Especially the small ones.

208.
A: I'm going to the gym after work.
B: You're so disciplined.

209.
A: I try to go at least three times a week.
B: That's very impressive.

210.
A: It helps me de-stress.
B: I should probably start going too.

211.
A: You can come with me if you want.
B: Maybe I'll take you up on that offer.

212.
A: The more the merrier.
B: Okay, you've convinced me.

213.
A: What's the matter? You look upset.
B: I had a bad day at work.

214.
A: Do you want to talk about it?
B: Not really. I just want to forget about it.

215.
A: I understand. Let's watch a funny movie.
B: That sounds like exactly what I need.

216.
A: Laughter is the best medicine.
B: You always know how to cheer me up.

217.
A: That's what I'm here for.
B: I'm lucky to have you as a friend.

218.
A: The feeling is mutual.
B: Now, let's find that movie.

219.
A: I have to work late tonight.
B: Oh, that's a shame.

220.
A: I'll have to cancel our plans. I'm sorry.
B: Don't worry about it. We can reschedule.

221.
A: How about tomorrow night?
B: Tomorrow works for me.

222.
A: Great. Same time, same place?
B: You got it.

223.
A: Thanks for being so flexible.
B: It's no problem at all.

224.
A: I'll make it up to you.
B: You don't have to, but I appreciate it.

225.
A: I can't find my glasses. Have you seen them?
B: I think they're on your head.

226.
A: Oh, you're right. How embarrassing.
B: Don't worry. It happens to me all the time.

227.
A: I'd lose my head if it wasn't attached.
B: I know the feeling.

228.
A: Can I borrow a pen?
B: Sure, here you go.

229.
A: Thanks. I'll give it back in a minute.
B: Keep it. I have plenty.

230.
A: Are you sure?
B: Absolutely.

231.
A: Well, thank you very much.
B: You're welcome.

232.
A: It looks like it's going to rain.
B: We should probably head back.

233.
A: You're right. I don't want to get caught in a storm.
B: Let's walk a bit faster.

234.
A: I'm right behind you.
B: The car is just up ahead.

235.
A: We made it just in time.
B: I can hear the thunder now.

236.
A: That was a close call.
B: For sure.

237.
A: How do I get to the city center?
B: You can take the number 12 bus.

238.
A: Where does it stop?
B: The bus stop is right across the street.

239.
A: And how much is the fare?
B: It's two dollars for a single trip.

240.
A: Thank you for the information.
B: No problem.

241.
A: I'm not sure what to do.
B: Maybe you should make a list of pros and cons.

242.
A: That's a logical approach.
B: It usually helps to see things more clearly.

243.
A: I'll give it a try. Thanks for the advice.
B: I hope it helps you make a decision.

244.
A: I have a splitting headache.
B: Have you taken anything for it?

245.
A: Not yet. I don't have any aspirin.
B: I have some in my bag. Let me get it for you.

246.
A: You're a true friend.
B: Here you go. Take two of these with water.

247.
A: Thank you. I really appreciate this.
B: I hope you feel better.

248.
A: I need to buy some groceries.
B: I can go with you if you like.

249.
A: That would be nice. I could use the company.
B: Let me just grab my coat.

250.
A: Are you ready?
B: Yes, let's go.

251.
A: Do you have a pet?
B: Yes, I have a dog.

252.
A: What's his name?
B: His name is Max.

253.
A: I love dogs. Can I see a picture?
B: Of course. Here's one of him in the park.

254.
A: He's adorable.
B: He's my best friend.

255.
A: I can see why.
B: Do you have any pets?

256.
A: I have a cat named Luna.
B: Cats are great too.

257.
A: They're very independent.
B: That's true.

258.
A: What time is it over there?
B: It's 3 AM.

259.
A: Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't realize it was so late.
B: It's okay. I'm still awake.

260.
A: I should let you go to sleep.
B: We can talk for a little longer if you want.

261.
A: No, you need your rest.
B: Okay. Talk to you tomorrow then.

262.
A: Sleep well.
B: You too.

263.
A: This coffee is too strong for me.
B: Would you like me to add more milk?

264.
A: Yes, please. That would be perfect.
B: Is this better?

265.
A: Much better, thank you.
B: Glad I could help.

266.
A: I think I'm allergic to something.
B: What are your symptoms?

267.
A: I can't stop sneezing.
B: It could be hay fever.

268.
A: I think you might be right.
B: You should try some allergy medicine.

269.
A: I'll pick some up on my way home.
B: I hope it gives you some relief.

270.
A: Me too. This is miserable.
B: I know the feeling.

271.
A: Let's get together soon.
B: I'd love that.

272.
A: Are you free next week?
B: I think so. Let me check my calendar.

273.
A: How about Wednesday?
B: Wednesday is perfect.

274.
A: Great. Let's say 7 PM at our usual spot.
B: Sounds like a plan. I'm looking forward to it.

275.
A: Me too. It's been too long.
B: I agree.

276.
A: This is taking forever.
B: Patience is a virtue.

277.
A: I'm not a very patient person.
B: I can tell.

278.
A: Is my shirt inside out?
B: No, it looks fine to me.

279.
A: Oh, good. I was worried for a second.
B: Why would you think that?

280.
A: Someone was looking at me funny.
B: Maybe they just liked your shirt.

281.
A: I guess that's possible.
B: Don't overthink it.

282.
A: You're right. I tend to do that.
B: We all do sometimes.

283.
A: Did you remember to lock the door?
B: I think so. Let me double-check.

284.
A: Better safe than sorry.
B: Yes, it's locked.

285.
A: Good. Now I can relax.
B: See? No need to worry.

286.
A: Can I give you some advice?
B: I'm open to it.

287.
A: I think you should apologize to her.
B: I'm not sure if I can.

288.
A: It's the right thing to do.
B: I know, but it's difficult.

289.
A: Your friendship is worth more than your pride.
B: You have a point.

290.
A: Just think about it.
B: I will. Thanks for being honest with me.

291.
A: Of course. I'm always here for you.
B: I know. And I appreciate it.

292.
A: What's the best way to learn a new language?
B: Immersion is probably the most effective way.

293.
A: So, like moving to the country?
B: That, or watching movies and listening to music in that language.

294.
A: That sounds more manageable.
B: And practice speaking every day, even if it's just to yourself.

295.
A: I'll try that. Thank you.
B: Good luck!

296.
A: I'm so proud of you.
B: Really? What for?

297.
A: For never giving up on your dream.
B: That means a lot to me.

298.
A: You're an inspiration.
B: Thank you. I'm just trying my best.

299.
A: Your best is more than enough.
B: You're too kind.

300.
A: It's just the truth.
B: I'm glad we're friends.

301.
A: What should I wear to the party?
B: Something casual but nice.

302.
A: How about this dress?
B: It looks great on you.

303.
A: You don't think it's too formal?
B: Not at all. It's perfect.

304.
A: Okay, I'll wear this then.
B: You'll be the best-dressed person there.

305.
A: Stop it, you're making me blush.
B: I'm just being honest.

306.
A: Can you keep a secret?
B: My lips are sealed.

307.
A: I'm planning a surprise party for Ben.
B: Oh, that's a great idea!

308.
A: Can you help me with the arrangements?
B: I'd be happy to.

309.
A: This is going to be great.
B: He's going to be so surprised.

310.
A: That's the plan.
B: Count me in.

311.
A: I'm trying to eat healthier.
B: That's a good goal.

312.
A: I'm eating more fruits and vegetables.
B: And drinking plenty of water?

313.
A: Yes, that too.
B: You'll feel the difference soon.

314.
A: I already do. I have more energy.
B: See? It pays off.

315.
A: Can you hold my bag for a second?
B: No problem.

316.
A: I just need to tie my shoelace.
B: Take your time.

317.
A: Okay, I'm done. Thanks.
B: You're welcome.

318.
A: I have a job interview tomorrow.
B: That's great! I'm rooting for you.

319.
A: I'm a little nervous.
B: Just be yourself. They'll love you.

320.
A: I hope so. I really want this job.
B: You'll do great. Just stay confident.

321.
A: Thanks for the pep talk.
B: Any time. Go get 'em.

322.
A: I have a craving for chocolate.
B: Me too. Let's get some ice cream.

323.
A: You read my mind.
B: What's your favorite flavor?

324.
A: Chocolate fudge brownie, of course.
B: An excellent choice.

325.
A: I'll get two scoops.
B: Same for me.

326.
A: This is the best decision we've made all day.
B: I couldn't agree more.

327.
A: Do you mind if I open the window?
B: Not at all. It's a bit stuffy in here.

328.
A: I need some fresh air.
B: That feels much better.

329.
A: It's a bit noisy outside, though.
B: I don't mind.

330.
A: Okay, I'll leave it open for a bit.
B: Sounds good.

331.
A: I'm sorry to bother you.
B: It's no bother at all. What's up?

332.
A: I just had a quick question.
B: Go ahead. Ask away.

333.
A: Never mind, I figured it out.
B: Oh, okay. Let me know if you need anything else.

334.
A: I will. Thanks again.
B: No worries.

335.
A: I can't decide what to get for lunch.
B: I'm in the mood for a sandwich.

336.
A: That actually sounds pretty good.
B: The deli down the street makes the best ones.

337.
A: Let's go there then.
B: My treat.

338.
A: Are you sure? You paid last time.
B: I'm sure. It's my turn.

339.
A: Well, I won't argue with that.
B: I didn't think you would.

340.
A: I'm going to be away for a week.
B: Where are you going?

341.
A: On a business trip to London.
B: Oh, how exciting.

342.
A: It's mostly just meetings.
B: Well, I hope you get some time to explore.

343.
A: I'm hoping to see a few sights.
B: Have a safe trip.

344.
A: Thank you. I'll bring you back a souvenir.
B: You don't have to do that.

345.
A: I want to.
B: In that case, I won't say no.

346.
A: I'll text you when I land.
B: Please do.

347.
A: I need to get a haircut.
B: Your hair looks fine to me.

348.
A: It's getting too long. I can't manage it.
B: I know a great salon if you're interested.

349.
A: Yes, please. I'm tired of my usual place.
B: I'll send you the details.

350.
A: You're the best.
B: I know.

351.
A: Can you believe this price?
B: It's a rip-off.

352.
A: Let's go somewhere else.
B: I agree. This is ridiculous.

353.
A: I saw a cheaper place a few blocks back.
B: Let's check it out.

354.
A: I have a feeling we'll have better luck there.
B: I hope you're right.

355.
A: My car broke down.
B: Oh no. Are you okay?

356.
A: I'm fine, just stranded.
B: Where are you? I can come and get you.

357.
A: You would do that for me?
B: Of course. Send me your location.

358.
A: I'm sending it now. Thank you so much.
B: I'm on my way. Stay put.

359.
A: You're a true hero.
B: Don't be silly. I'm just helping a friend.

360.
A: It feels good to be home.
B: There's no place like it.

361.
A: I'm going to take a long, hot bath.
B: You deserve it after a long day.

362.
A: What are your plans for the evening?
B: Just relaxing on the couch with a good book.

363.
A: Sounds perfect.
B: It's my favorite way to unwind.

364.
A: Enjoy your book.
B: You enjoy your bath.

365.
A: I will.
B: See you tomorrow.

366.
A: I think we're going in the wrong direction.
B: Let me check the GPS.

367.
A: What does it say?
B: You're right. We missed a turn.

368.
A: I thought so. The street names didn't look familiar.
B: We need to turn around at the next light.

369.
A: It's a good thing you checked.
B: We would have ended up in another state.

370.
A: That would have been an adventure.
B: A very inconvenient one.

371.
A: I need your honest opinion.
B: Okay, I'm ready.

372.
A: Does this make me look fat?
B: Not at all. It's very flattering.

373.
A: Are you just saying that to be nice?
B: I promise, I'm telling you the truth.

374.
A: Okay, I believe you.
B: You look great. Don't worry.

375.
A: I'm so clumsy. I just spilled coffee on my shirt.
B: It's okay. It happens.

376.
A: Now I have to go to the meeting with a stain.
B: Do you have a jacket you can wear over it?

377.
A: Yes, I do. That's a great idea.
B: See? Problem solved.

378.
A: You're so good at finding solutions.
B: I try to stay calm under pressure.

379.
A: I need to learn to do that.
B: It just takes practice.

380.
A: It's so quiet without the kids here.
B: It's a nice change of pace, isn't it?

381.
A: It is, but I kind of miss the noise.
B: I know what you mean. The house feels empty.

382.
A: Let's enjoy the peace while it lasts.
B: They'll be back before we know it.

383.
A: And the chaos will resume.
B: Wouldn't have it any other way.

384.
A: Me neither.
B: They're our little monsters.

385.
A: The meeting was so boring.
B: I almost fell asleep.

386.
A: It could have been an email.
B: I completely agree. What a waste of time.

387.
A: At least it's over now.
B: Let's go get some coffee to wake up.

388.
A: You're speaking my language.
B: Let's go.

389.
A: I have to finish this project by Friday.
B: That's a tight deadline.

390.
A: I know. I'm going to be working around the clock.
B: Let me know if there's anything I can do to help.

391.
A: I appreciate that, thank you.
B: We're a team. We help each other out.

392.
A: That's why I like working with you.
B: Likewise.

393.
A: Do you have a minute?
B: Sure. What's on your mind?

394.
A: I wanted to run an idea by you.
B: I'm listening.

395.
A: What if we tried a new marketing strategy?
B: Tell me more. I'm intrigued.

396.
A: I was thinking we could focus more on social media.
B: That could be a good move.

397.
A: Let's brainstorm some ideas this afternoon.
B: Sounds like a plan.

398.
A: I'm not a big fan of public speaking.
B: A lot of people feel that way.

399.
A: I get so nervous.
B: The key is to be prepared.

400.
A: I practice, but my mind goes blank.
B: Try to focus on just one person in the audience.

401.
A: I've never tried that before.
B: It can help make it feel less intimidating.

402.
A: I'll give it a shot next time. Thanks.
B: You'll do great.

403.
A: The sun is shining.
B: Let's go for a walk in the park.

404.
A: I'd love to. I need to stretch my legs.
B: The fresh air will do us good.

405.
A: It's so nice to get out of the office.
B: It really is. I feel more energized already.

406.
A: We should do this more often.
B: Let's make it a weekly thing.

407.
A: I like that idea.
B: It's a date.

408.
A: What's for breakfast?
B: I'm making pancakes.

409.
A: My favorite! Do you need any help?
B: You can get the maple syrup out.

410.
A: On it. This smells delicious.
B: They're almost ready.

411.
A: I'm starving.
B: Breakfast is served.

412.
A: You're the best cook.
B: I'm glad you think so.

413.
A: I have a dentist appointment today.
B: I hope it's just a check-up.

414.
A: It is, but I still hate going.
B: I know what you mean. The sound of the drill is the worst.

415.
A: Don't remind me.
B: It will be over before you know it.

416.
A: I hope you're right.
B: And you'll have sparkling clean teeth.

417.
A: That's the only good part.
B: Look on the bright side.

418.
A: Let's have a movie marathon this weekend.
B: Yes! What genre should we watch?

419.
A: How about classic 80s comedies?
B: Perfect. I'll bring the popcorn.

420.
A: And I'll get the drinks.
B: It's going to be a fun weekend.

421.
A: I can't wait.
B: Me neither.

422.
A: This line is moving so slowly.
B: We should have come earlier.

423.
A: Hindsight is 20/20.
B: Let's just hope we get in before it starts.

424.
A: We still have about 20 minutes.
B: We should be fine then.

425.
A: I hope the movie is worth the wait.
B: The reviews were excellent.

426.
A: That's a good sign.
B: Look, the line is moving now.

427.
A: Finally.
B: See? I told you we'd be fine.

428.
A: My new neighbors are so loud.
B: Have you tried talking to them?

429.
A: Not yet. I don't want to cause any trouble.
B: Maybe they don't realize how loud they're being.

430.
A: That's possible.
B: A polite conversation might solve the problem.

431.
A: I'll try talking to them tomorrow.
B: I hope it goes well.

432.
A: Me too. I need to get some sleep.
B: Maybe try some earplugs tonight.

433.
A: Good idea.
B: Let me know how it goes.

434.
A: I'm looking forward to the holidays.
B: It's my favorite time of year.

435.
A: All the lights and decorations are so beautiful.
B: And spending time with family.

436.
A: That's the best part.
B: Do you have any traditions?

437.
A: We always bake cookies on Christmas Eve.
B: That sounds lovely.

438.
A: What about you?
B: We watch classic holiday movies all day.

439.
A: That's a great tradition too.
B: It gets you right in the holiday spirit.

440.
A: Can I get a ride to the airport?
B: Of course. What time do you need to be there?

441.
A: My flight is at 10, so maybe around 7?
B: 7 AM works for me. I'll pick you up.

442.
A: Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.
B: It's no trouble at all.

443.
A: I'll pay you for the gas.
B: Don't be silly. It's on me.

444.
A: You're too generous.
B: That's what friends are for.

445.
A: I'm trying to learn how to cook.
B: That's a great skill to have.

446.
A: I'm starting with simple recipes.
B: That's the best way to start.

447.
A: Last night I made spaghetti.
B: How did it turn out?

448.
A: It was actually edible.
B: That's a success then!

449.
A: I was pretty proud of myself.
B: You should be.

450.
A: Keep practicing and you'll be a chef in no time.
B: Maybe not a chef, but I'll be able to feed myself.

451.
A: What's your dream job?
B: I've always wanted to be a writer.

452.
A: You'd be a great writer.
B: You think so?

453.
A: You have a way with words.
B: Thanks. That means a lot.

454.
A: Have you ever tried writing a book?
B: I've started a few times, but never finished.

455.
A: You should try again.
B: Maybe I will. You've inspired me.

456.
A: That's what I like to hear.
B: I'll dedicate my first book to you.

457.
A: I'll hold you to that.
B: It's a promise.

458.
A: I can't connect to the internet.
B: Have you tried restarting the router?

459.
A: That's the first thing I did.
B: Is the light blinking?

460.
A: Yes, it's blinking green.
B: Maybe you should call your service provider.

461.
A: I guess I'll have to. This is so frustrating.
B: I know. We rely on it for everything.

462.
A: Tell me about it.
B: I hope you get it fixed soon.

463.
A: Do you have any change?
B: Let me check. I think I have a few quarters.

464.
A: I just need one for the parking meter.
B: Here you go.

465.
A: Thanks. You saved me from getting a ticket.
B: Happy to help.

466.
A: I owe you one.
B: Just pay it forward.

467.
A: I can do that.
B: That's the spirit.

468.
A: Let's order a pizza.
B: I'm down for that. What toppings?

469.
A: How about half pepperoni, half veggie?
B: Sounds like a good compromise.

470.
A: I'll call it in.
B: Should I get some drinks from the fridge?

471.
A: Yes, please.
B: Pizza night is the best night.

472.
A: It really is.
B: And there are no dishes to wash.

473.
A: That's the best part.
B: I couldn't agree more.

474.
A: This puzzle is impossible.
B: Let me see. Maybe a fresh pair of eyes will help.

475.
A: I've been staring at it for an hour.
B: How about this piece? Does it fit here?

476.
A: I can't believe I missed that. It fits perfectly.
B: Sometimes you just need to take a break.

477.
A: You're right. Thanks for the help.
B: Teamwork makes the dream work.

478.
A: That's very cheesy.
B: But it's true.

479.
A: I suppose it is.
B: Now let's finish this puzzle.

480.
A: I have a surprise for you.
B: I love surprises. What is it?

481.
A: Close your eyes.
B: Okay, they're closed.

482.
A: I got us tickets to the concert on Friday.
B: No way! You're kidding me.

483.
A: I'm not kidding. Open your eyes.
B: I can't believe it! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

484.
A: I knew you'd be happy.
B: This is the best surprise ever.

485.
A: I'm glad you like it.
B: Like it? I love it!

486.
A: Let me get the door for you.
B: Oh, thank you. You're a gentleman.

487.
A: Just being polite.
B: It's a rare quality these days.

488.
A: I was raised to have good manners.
B: Your parents did a good job.

489.
A: I'll tell them you said so.
B: Please do.

490.
A: I think I'll take a nap.
B: You look tired.

491.
A: I didn't sleep well last night.
B: A short nap will do you good.

492.
A: Wake me up in an hour?
B: I will. Sweet dreams.

493.
A: Thanks.
B: Don't let the bedbugs bite.

494.
A: I have a song stuck in my head.
B: Which one? Maybe you can pass it to me.

495.
A: It's that new pop song that's always on the radio.
B: Oh, I know the one. It's very catchy.

496.
A: Too catchy. It's driving me crazy.
B: The only way to get rid of it is to listen to another song.

497.
A: That's a good idea. Put on some rock music.
B: You got it.

498.
A: I'm so full. I can't eat another bite.
B: The food was delicious, though.

499.
A: It was. My compliments to the chef.
B: Shall we ask for the bill?

500.
A: Let's sit for a little while longer.
B: Good idea. There's no rush.
