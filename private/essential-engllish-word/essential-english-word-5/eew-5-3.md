# The Bachelor's Lesson

A **keen** young **bachelor** had finished his studies at the university. As soon as he had received his **diploma**, he **asserted** to everyone he met that he was the smartest person in town.

“I **excel** at everything I study,” he said, bragging about his knowledge. “I’ve mastered **calculus** and **physiology**. I even understand the great **theoretical** teachings of science, such as **relativity**. There is nothing that I don’t know. Whether it’s the movements of **celestial** objects, like planets and stars, or how to **harness** the power of **radioactive** substances, I know everything.”

But actually, there was something the **bachelor** did not know. Though his **analytic** abilities were great, he failed to notice he was missing something very important in his life.

![alt text](eew-5-3/23.png)

One day while walking through town, the **bachelor** witnessed a **collision** between two cars. Both drivers appeared to be injured, but the scholar only stood and watched.

He thought to himself, “Those idiots should have been more alert. They really must not be very **competent**.” He never thought the drivers needed help.

![alt text](eew-5-3/25.png)

“Please help me,” said the female driver in a weak voice. “Help me, too,” said the male driver. “I’m hurt and can’t move.”

Suddenly the **bachelor** realized he was the only person near the accident. He quit thinking and ran to help the drivers. He carefully helped them out of their vehicles and then called an ambulance.

![alt text](eew-5-3/26.png)

The drivers were saved, and the **bachelor** felt the best he had in his entire life. Studying **mythology**, **sociology**, and **geology** didn’t give him this wonderful feeling. It was the act of helping others, not his **cognitive** skills, that gave him this great feeling.

![alt text](eew-5-3/27.png)

He had learned an important lesson. He learned that **intellect** isn’t everything; being helpful is just as important. “Having only a brain is not enough,” he thought. “You must also have a heart.”
