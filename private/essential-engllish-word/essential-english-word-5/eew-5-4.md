Mr. Pig returned to the factory and started making changes. However, most were not very nice, and some were not **legitimate**.

First, he fired all his employees. Then he **automated** the entire factory. Machines now made everything, and the other animals, Mr. Rabbit, Mr. Sheep, and Mr. Dog had no jobs. Next, he **bribed** some **corrupt** senators into **legislating** special **subsidies** for the factory. Finally, instead of paying a company to **dispose** of the factory’s **rubbish** properly, he **violated** the law by throwing it into the river to save money.

All **transactions** with Pig’s factory stopped. The factory lost money, and Pig lost his job. He realized his mistakes too late. He had tried to become rich by saving money any way possible, but the cheapest way was not always the best.
