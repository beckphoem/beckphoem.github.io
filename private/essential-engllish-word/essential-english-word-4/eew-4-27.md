# a Dying Forest

**Rainforests** provide much of the world’s **oxygen** supply. But the forests’ **exotic** trees and animals are being killed to make room for farmers and roads. People have been trying to **conserve** rainforests for years. But another type of forest—the cloud forest—is just as **beneficial** to humans. Cloud forests are also in danger of disappearing, but little is being done to save them.

![alt text](eew-4-27/21.png)

These forests are located at the tops of mountains, generally near the **equator**. These humid, **wooded** mountaintops are mainly in African and Central and South American countries. They are called “cloud forests” because their height allows for the **formation** of clouds among the trees.

Rainforests produce large amounts of oxygen. Cloud forests produce **comparative** amounts of water. The trees in these forests pull water out of the clouds. The moisture gathers on the leaves. When it drips, it is **deposited** into streams. The streams flow into towns at the bottom of the mountain. Then, it’s **distributed** to people. The yearly **cumulative** rainfall in these areas is 173-198 centimeters. Cloud forests can pull in up to 60 percent of that. This water is **crucial** to the plants and the people in the area. It helps them survive.

Cloud forests are also the **birthplace** of countless species of plants that can’t be found anywhere else. One small cloud forest has the **capacity** for as many types of plants as there are in all of Europe. There are so many, in fact, that scientists haven’t made a **comprehensive** list of them yet.

![alt text](eew-4-27/24.png)

These forests are being destroyed with increasing **frequency**. Trees are being cut down, and roads are being built in their place. Some people have an **objective** to get **federal** money to protect the forests. But they have had little success. Another **strategy** is to replace the destroyed plants. That, too, has been difficult because the plants are so unique. There’s plenty of work to be done, but saving the cloud forests is still a possibility.
