# Kara Goes Camping
“Kara, would you like to go camping with my family?” asked Tracy. Kara had never been camping before, but she decided to go anyway. That weekend, they drove to Estes Park. When they arrived, Kara looked around. She felt so far from **civilization**.

Tracy closed the **lid** and told Kara, “Today will be fun, I promise!” Kara didn’t believe her. She missed her **convenient** life in the city. She was used to an **urban** lifestyle.

That night, they made a fire. They sat around it while Mr. Grieves told scary stories. Kara had a lot of fun. Camping was a good way for friends to spend time together, she realized.

The next day, it was time for them to leave. She felt sad while they exited the park. She didn’t like camping at first, but she learned how fun it could be over the weekend.
