# Gilbert and the Lizard Gilbert and the Lizard

Eliza disliked Australia. Firstly, she’d had to spend twenty uncomfortable hours on an **aircraft** getting here.

“Let me sit down, Gilbert. I’m not **hardy** like you,” she said, eventually.

They sat under a tree. There were lots of birds in that **secluded**, **rural** place, and they watched them flying **overhead**.

Then suddenly Gilbert saw something on a rock. “That’s strange,” said Gilbert. “That looks like a Red **Swamp** Lizard, but I thought that **species** was **extinct**.” He carefully picked it up. “Yes, it is! I’m going to take it back to the **Zoology Institute**. They will be filled with so much **jealousy** when they see what I have found!”

For the next few days, Gilbert fed and **nurtured** the lizard. But the lizard wasn’t happy. It lost its beautiful red color and began to look ordinary. In fact, Gilbert started to wonder whether it was special at all. He went outside and found a common lizard on a piece of **concrete**. When he compared them, they looked exactly alike. The lizard was only red in the **swamp**!

Gilbert said to Eliza, “I’m going to return this lizard to the **swamp**. I’ve learned an important lesson. Home is where we are happiest. At home, we are special like the red lizard. We can never be so happy when we are away.”

“Good,” said Eliza. “So, can we go home now?”
