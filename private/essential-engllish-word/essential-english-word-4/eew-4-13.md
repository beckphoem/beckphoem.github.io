## THE BIG RACE

Alex woke up scared because of a **nightmare**. In it, he was running a race. Just before he reached the finish line, he fell. Alex thought that it was a **subconscious** way that his brain was trying to **warn** him about something. He was going to run in a race that day. Did the dream mean he was going to lose? He became **irritable**.

“Good morning,” said Alex’s mother. “I **brewed** some coffee and made you a special breakfast.” Alex didn’t want it. It had too much sugar. He needed something **nutritious**. So he prepared a meal that contained a lot of **protein** to **maximize** his energy for the race. Then his father asked, “Do you want help packing your **stuff**?” “No,” replied Alex. He wanted to make sure that he had all of his equipment for the race.

Alex’s family got in their **van** and drove to the track. When they arrived, a boy ran toward Alex. “Can I have your **autograph**?” asked the boy. Alex had many fans. He usually **charmed** everybody he spoke to. However, today Alex refused to give the boy his **signature**. He needed to think about his race.

He took his jump rope from his bag and started his usual **workout**. Maybe exercising would help him forget about the **nightmare**. “The race is about to start,” said the coach. **Beads** of sweat formed out of Alex’s sweat glands. All he could think about was his terrible dream. He thought it might be his **destiny** to become a loser. While he was thinking, he didn’t hear the **horn** that meant the race had started.

The runners **zoomed** toward the finish line. By the time Alex started, he **lagged** far behind everyone. He couldn’t run fast enough to catch up to the others. He had lost the race! He shouldn’t have let the **nightmare** **affect** him. He should have stayed focused on the race.
