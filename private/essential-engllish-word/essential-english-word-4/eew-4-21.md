# The Teller and the Thieves

A **teller** at a bank suspected some of her fellow employees of not being very **trustworthy**. She thought they were stealing. In order to catch them, though, she needed some way to link them to the crime.

![alt text](eew-4-21/21.png)

She had a **background** in **religion** and **folklore**. She remembered that one **religion**’s **literature** had a **myth** that **chronicled** how a group of thieves was captured.

In the **millennium**-old story, coins of **copper** were covered with **venom** taken from a poisonous snake. The coins were left as **bait** for the robbers. When they touched the coins, the **venom** **infected** their bodies through their skin. The **venom** ran through their **veins**, and they all became very sick as if they had a **disease**. It made their skin purple. The police arrested whoever had purple skin.

![alt text](eew-4-21/22.png)

She knew she couldn’t use **venom** because it might hurt someone. However, she thought of a way to **update** the old story. She decided to cover a **sum** of money with a special powder. If people touched the money, the powder would cause their skin to **itch**. She placed the stack of money in the bank’s safe. No one was supposed to take money from the safe. If somebody did, then they had to be stealing.

Within a few hours, three of her coworkers were scratching their hands and arms. They **itched** so badly that they couldn’t even work. She checked the money, and it was gone. She told her boss what she had done, and he had the thieves arrested. He thanked her and **promoted** her.

Because events from history often repeat, ancient **literature** had helped the **teller** solve a crime. She proved that stories from the past still **relate** with the problems of today, and they can be helpful in solving problems.
