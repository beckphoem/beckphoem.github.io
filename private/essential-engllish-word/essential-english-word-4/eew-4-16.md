Laika, the Space Dog Laika, the Space Dog

One of the world’s most **beloved** space travelers was also the furriest.

Laika was a little dog living on the streets of Moscow, Russia.

She **matured** on the streets because no one would give her a home.

She had to learn how to live without eating much.

She found ways to keep warm in a very cold **climate**.

Scientists thought a tough dog like Laika would do well in a project they were putting together.

In a **prior** launch, Russia had put the first man-made object into space.

Now, scientists wanted to see if a living thing could go to space.

**Although** many facts about space had been learned, they weren’t enough to help send humans to space safely.

Laika and two other dogs were chosen to help scientists with their **research**.

The animals were used in a **variety** of tests.

In the end, though, only Laika would go to space.

On November 3,1957 the Sputnik 2 spaceship was **due** to leave Earth.

Scientists carefully **applied** wires to Laika’s skin to **measure** her body’s reactions once she got into space.

Laika also wore a special **leash**.

Without it, she would float around in the spaceship.

Soon after, Laika left the planet.

Scientists on Earth **awaited** information from the ship.

But in the **midst** of so much excitement, something very sad happened.

Scientists were able to tell that Laika was under a lot of stress.

The trip **confused** and scared her.

Laika’s **entire** ship had become as hot as a **furnace**.

Scientists were powerless to help the dog in her **misery**.

After about five hours, Laika died.

Some have **complained** that the little dog should never have been used in the mission.

Scientists knew that she would not survive the trip.

Laika was never **buried**, but an **establish**ed memorial has been **establish**ed in Moscow.

There are many songs and books about her, too.

It seems that Laika became a hero to many people.
