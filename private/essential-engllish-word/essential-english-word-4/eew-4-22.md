# The Scribe’s Warning (Từ vựng in đậm)

A great and powerful **empire** needed the wood from its western areas to build palaces and homes for the emperor and his friends. However, the empire had **depleted** many of the forests. The trees were important to the western areas’ **economy**. With no trees to sell, the **commerce** in that area was **reduced**. Citizens could no longer purchase the **goods** that they needed to survive. Their life became difficult.

![alt text](eew-4-22/21.png)

A poor **scribe** from the area wanted to help. He **hitchhiked** to the capital to ask the emperor for **charity**. He was invited to the palace. It was large and **cozy**. Tables were loaded with food, and fires burned warmly in every fireplace.

![alt text](eew-4-22/22.png)

The emperor sat up upon his **throne**, and the scribe stood in front of him.

“I’ve come to ask for help,” the scribe said. “We’re all very poor and hungry. You’ve used up all of the forests, and now we have nothing to sell.” Then he added a warning. “If we don’t receive help, I’m afraid that the entire empire will suffer. We must establish some **unity**.”

![alt text](eew-4-22/23.png)

Upon hearing the scribe’s request, the emperor’s bad **temper** surfaced. He **mocked** the scribe. “You think I should help,” he said and laughed. “You should just be happy to belong to this great empire. You will get nothing from me.”

![alt text](eew-4-22/24.png)

The emperor felt no **pity** for the citizens of the western area. They were **condemned** to starve. The scribe returned home with nothing.

Not long after, an enemy invaded the empire from the west. They were marching to the capital. Because the citizens felt **persecuted** by the emperor, they remained **neutral**. They didn’t fight the invaders but allowed them to march freely to the capital.

![alt text](eew-4-22/25.png)

The emperor was defeated. If he had **heeded** the words of the scribe, then the citizens might have been the **victors**. But because he had treated them badly, they treated him badly in return.
