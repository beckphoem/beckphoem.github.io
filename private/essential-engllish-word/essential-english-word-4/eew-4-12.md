## THE SUN AND THE NORTH
The Sun and the North Wind The Sun and the North Wind
The Sun and the North Wind were talking to each other in the sky. The North Wind was saying that he was better than everyone else. The Sun listened as the North Wind talked with **enthusiasm** about how powerful he was and how he could push something from one **continent** to another with one breath. He said, “I am the strongest thing in the sky.”

“Really?” asked the Sun. “How do you know that you are more powerful than the stars, or the rain, or even me?”

The North Wind laughed with **disrespect**. He yelled, “You? That’s a joke!”

This hurt the Sun. He was usually **timid** and did not want to cause **conflict**. Today he decided that he should teach the North Wind a lesson.

In the **meantime**, a man began walking along the **avenue** down on Earth. When the Sun looked down on the **terrain** below, he saw the man. He pointed down to the Earth and said, “Do you see that man walking below? I bet I can get his jacket off of him. Can you?”

“Of course!” the North Wind replied as he took a deep breath and filled his lungs with air. He used all of his **muscle**s in his face and **belly** to **blow** winds at his target in **succession**.

The **harsh** air **current**s made the man cold. The man pulled his jacket more tightly around him. It did not come off. The Sun decided to **rescue** the man from the **mischief** of the North Wind. He said, “May I try?” Then he sent down sunlight that made the man warm. The man **lean**ed against a tree. He took off his jacket and enjoyed the nice weather.

“You are very powerful,” the Sun said to the North Wind, “but you use **violence** in your **bid** to appear strong. You should think of an **alternative**. The strongest people don’t use force to get what they want.”
