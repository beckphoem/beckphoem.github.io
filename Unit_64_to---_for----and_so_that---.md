# Unit 64 to..., for ... and so that ...

# A
We say
- I called the restaurant **to reserve** a table.
- What do you need **to make** bread?
- We shouted **to warn** everybody of the danger.
- This letter is **to confirm** the decisions we made at our meeting last week.
- The president has a team of  bodyguards **to protect** him.

In these examples ***to*** ...(**to reserve** .../ **to make**... etc) tells us the purpose of something: why somebody does something, has something, needs something etc., or why something exists.

# B
We say 'a place **to park**', 'something **to eat**', 'work **to do**' etc. :

- It's hard to find **a place to park** in the city centre. ( = a place where you can park)

- Would you like **something to eat**? (= something that you can eat)

- Do you have **much work to do**? (= work that you must do)

Sometimes there is a preposition (on, with etc.) after the verb:
- Is there **a chair to sit on** ? (= a chair that I can sit on)
- I get lonely if there's **nobody to talk to**.
- I need **something to open** this bottle **with**

We also say **money/time/change/opportunity/energy/courage** (etc.) **to** do something:

- They gave us **money to buy** food.
- Do you have **much opportunity to practise** your English?
- I need **a few days to think** about your proposal.

# C
Comapre **for** ... and **to** ...

|**for** + noun| **to** + verb|
|---|---|
|We stopped **for petrol** | We stopped **to get** petrol|
|I had to run **for the bus** | I had to run **to catch the bus**|

You can say '**for** somebody **to do** something' :
- There weren't any chairs **for us to sit on**, so we sat on the floor.

We use **for**(do)**ing** to say what something is used for:
- This brush is **for washing** the dishes.

But we do not use **for-ing** to say why somebody does something:
- I went into the kitchen **to wash** the dishes. (not for washing)

You can use **What...for**? to ask about purpose:
- **What** is this switch **for**? (= what is it used for?)
- **What** did you do that **for**? (= why did you do that?)

# D
**so that**

We use **so that** (not **to**...) especially with **can/could** and **will/would**:
- She's learning English **so that** she **can** study in Canada.
- We moved to London **so that** we **could** see our friends more often.
- I hurried **so that** I **wouldn't** be late. (= because I didn't want to be late)

You can leave out **that**. So you can say:
- I hurried **so that**I wouldn't be late or I hurried **so** I wouldn't be late.
